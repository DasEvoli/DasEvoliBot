# DasEvoliBot
My own discord bot with a fighting game. I originally created this bot for a friend who wanted a little fun game on his Discord server. It's full of "inside jokes" so please understand some silliness.

If you want to join this bot to your server follow this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=549831896759140353&permissions=8&scope=bot

Permissions probably need some adjustments. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.5.3 or higher

## Setup
* pip install discord
* pip install requests
* Fill data in settings.py

## Adding settings.py
You need to add a settings.py file in your main dictionary to add your own token.
Insert: Token: "test123token"
