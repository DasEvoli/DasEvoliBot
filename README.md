# DasEvoliBot
My own discord bot with a fighting game. I originally created this bot for a friend who wanted a little fun game on his Discord server. It's full of "inside jokes" so please understand some silliness.

If you want to join this bot to your server follow this link: https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=549831896759140353&permissions=8&scope=bot

Permissions probably need some adjustments. 

## Requirements
* Python 3.7
* [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
* Discordserver to test

## Adding settings.py
You need to add a settings.py file in your main dictionary to add your own token.
Insert: Token: "yourtoken"
